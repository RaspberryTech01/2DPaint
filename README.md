# 2DPaint
2D Paint application made in Windows Forms

How it works:

On load up the application creates a grid using tablelayoutview. A function in the secondary class checks to see which x and y pixed was clicked on. This is then converted to use specific row and column clicked on by using a modulo calculation.
